# 🧮 Simple Calculator

A minimalist and functional basic calculator, built using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

## ✨ Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a basic calculator with a clean, modern, and user-friendly design. The interface mimics the look of a physical calculator, featuring subtle shadow effects for a sense of depth and style.

## 🚀 How to Run

The calculator is entirely front-end based. It does not require any server or compilation process.

1.  **Clone/Download the Project:** Obtain the `index.html` and `style.css` files.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply double-click on the `index.html` file.
3.  **Usage:** Start typing in numbers and operations!

## 💡 Features

* **Basic Operations:** Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
* **Display:** A large, visible display screen for inputs and results.
* **Clear All Button (`AC`):** Clears the entire current input.
* **Delete/Backspace Button (`DE`):** Deletes the last character entered.
* **Decimal Support:** Includes the decimal point button (`.`).
* **Double Zero (`00`):** Button for fast input of zeros.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML:** The basic structure of the calculator (buttons, display, form).
* **CSS:** Styling, layout (using Flexbox), colors, and shadow effects (for a Soft-UI/Neumorphic aesthetic).
* **JavaScript (Inline):** The core calculation logic is implemented using the built-in `eval()` function directly within the buttons' `onclick` attributes.
